# Binary-Search-Tree-ASM
## Description
This MIPS program implements fundamental Binary Search Tree (BST) operations, including node initialization, key search, node counting, deletion, and in-order/pre-order traversal. Using recursion and pointer manipulation, it manages BST functions with proper stack handling to ensure correct execution in a MIPS assembly environment.


## What I learned: 
    - How to implement Binary Search Tree (BST) operations in MIPS assembly
    - Using recursion effectively in assembly language
    - Manipulating pointers and memory addresses for tree nodes
    - Managing the stack for function calls and returns in MIPS
    - Performing in-order and pre-order tree traversals
    - Implementing node search, insertion, and deletion at the assembly level
    - Understanding low-level control flow and branching in MIPS

## How To run it:
### To run this MIPS assembly sorting program, users should:
    - Open the .s file in a MIPS simulator such as Mars or SPIM.
    - Assemble the code using the simulator’s assemble or build function.
    - Load the provided test file containing sample input arrays for sorting.
    - Execute the program within the simulator, using run or step options to observe the sorting process.
    - Review the sorted output in the simulator’s memory or registers window.
    - The repository includes a test file for convenient verification of functionality. Debugging functions 
    (merge_debug and quicksort_debug) are available for step-by-step monitoring.
