# Binary-Search-Tree-ASM
This MIPS program implements fundamental Binary Search Tree (BST) operations, including node initialization, key search, node counting, deletion, and in-order/pre-order traversal. Using recursion and pointer manipulation, it manages BST functions with proper stack handling to ensure correct execution in a MIPS assembly environment.
